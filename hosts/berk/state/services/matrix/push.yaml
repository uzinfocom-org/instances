  #  # This enables sending the unread message, notification and missed call
  #  # counts in the push notification data. While this value is useful for non-
  #  # encrypted contexts, when the user is part of encrypted rooms these
  #  # count values won't be accurate due to the homeserver being unable
  #  # to decrypt user and keyword mentions. So there's no point in sending them.
  #  # If the associated app supports encryption then this should probably be
  #  # false. Defaults to true.

  #  # This is the maximum number of in-flight requests *for this pushkin*
  #  # before additional notifications will be failed.
  #  # (This is a robustness measure to prevent one pushkin stacking up with
  #  #  queued requests and saturating the inbound connection queue of a load
  #  #  balancer or reverse proxy).

  #  # This allows you to specify additional options to send to Firebase.
  #  #
  #  # Of particular interest, admins who wish to support iOS apps using Firebase
  #  # probably wish to set content-available, and may need to set mutable-content.
  #  # (content-available allows your iOS app to be woken up by data messages,
  #  # and mutable-content allows your notification to be modified by a
  #  # Notification Service app extension).
  #  #
  #  # See https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref
  #  # for the exhaustive list of valid options.
  #  #
  #  # Do not specify `data`, `priority`, `to` or `registration_ids` as they may
  #  # be overwritten or lead to an invalid request.
